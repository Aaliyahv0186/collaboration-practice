# Collaboration Test
## _Practicing Merges & Conflicts_

---

## Task 0: Setting Up

1. Partner up. The directions for this repo are meant for two people.  If there is a third person, just rotate drivers/navigators.
2. Notice the files in this repo:  
  a. **README.md**: these directions _(do not alter this file)_  
  b. **line-numbers.md**: where you will practice!
3. Decide on ONE person to fork this repo. You are the owner.  From now on, you will be referred to as the **owner**.  Go ahead and fork this repo.
4. **Owner**: Settings (gear icon) > Collaborators > type your partner's username and "Add Collaborator".  From now on, they will be referred to as the **collaborator**.
5. **Collaborator**: check your email.  You should receive an email that contains a link to this remote repo and a message saying "You can now push to this repository."  Open the link.
6. **Both partners**: copy the `SSH URL`. In your IDE, make sure you are in `~/workspace` and then `git clone URL`.  Then `cd` into `collaboration-test`.
7. The best way to do this activity is to open up:  
  a. the **Preview** of `README.md` _(but you don't need the raw markdown)_  
  b. the **raw markdown** of `line-numbers.md` _(but you don't need the preview)_
